Textures included with CS 6.6

Background: Four unlucky tourists have 
stumbled upon a secret drug operation, 
headquartered in an old castle on a remote 
Scottish Isle. They alerted authorities just
before getting captured by the drug dealers.

Counter-Terrorists: Rescue the hostages.
Terrorists: Stop the CT's.
Other Notes: There are two hostage rescue 
points on the map. 
Thanks D-L ;-)
