Both teams start on opposite ends of a
map which is separated by a metal wall in
the middle.

Every 5 seconds, the fence will raise and
will close in another 5 seconds

Other Notes: Use the time when the wall is
closed to your advantage by quickly changing
positions. This map requires quick reflex
and good aim, training your skills with all
guns. 

Tip: Remember which guns can penetrate walls.
